# Note

- A trivial solution is to store the values in an array and compute the pair sums on this array. This has time complexity $\mathsf{O}(n)$ and space complexity $\mathsf{O}(n)$.

- Another solution is to reverse the second half of the list and traverse the list toward its middle via two pointers. This has time complexity $\mathsf{O}(n)$ and space complexity $\mathsf{O}(1)$.
