# Note

- This is very similar to Fibonacci sequence. The solution has an $\mathsf{O}(n)$ space complexity. However, this can be improved to $\mathsf{O}(1)$ by only memorizing the last three terms of the sequence.

- Generally, a good first step is to write down the bottom-up Dynamic Programmding (DP) solution without any memory optimizations. Once you have understood this step, you can think of improving memory usuage.
