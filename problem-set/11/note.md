# Note

- The exhaustive search solution has $\mathsf{O}(n^2)$ time complexity.
- The key point to the $\mathsf{O}(n)$ solution is to consider two pointers for the left and right walls. Then, we move the pointer to the shorter wall toward the middle while keeping track of the maximum capacity seen so far.
